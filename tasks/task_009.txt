# Task ID: 9
# Title: Grafana Dashboard Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up Grafana dashboards for monitoring trading performance, equity curve, and risk metrics
# Details:
1. Install and configure Grafana 10
2. Set up data sources:
   - PostgreSQL for trade data and performance metrics
   - InfluxDB for OHLCV data
3. Create dashboards for:
   - Portfolio Overview (balance, equity curve, exposure)
   - Performance Metrics (win rate, profit factor, Sharpe, Calmar)
   - Risk Monitoring (drawdown, volatility)
   - Trade Analysis (pairs, timeframes, win/loss distribution)
4. Implement alerts for critical thresholds
5. Configure user authentication
6. Set up automatic dashboard refresh

Grafana Dashboard Configuration:
```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "id": null,
    "title": "NASOSv5_mod3 Trading Performance",
    "tags": ["trading", "crypto"],
    "timezone": "browser",
    "panels": [
      {
        "title": "Equity Curve",
        "type": "graph",
        "datasource": "PostgreSQL",
        "targets": [
          {
            "rawSql": "SELECT ts as time, balance_usdt FROM equity_curve ORDER BY ts",
            "refId": "A"
          }
        ],
        "fieldConfig": {
          "defaults": {
            "color": {
              "mode": "palette-classic"
            },
            "custom": {
              "axisLabel": "USDT",
              "lineInterpolation": "linear"
            }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "title": "Drawdown",
        "type": "graph",
        "datasource": "PostgreSQL",
        "targets": [
          {
            "rawSql": "WITH max_balance AS (SELECT MAX(balance_usdt) OVER (ORDER BY ts ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as peak, balance_usdt, ts FROM equity_curve) SELECT ts as time, (1 - balance_usdt/peak) * 100 as drawdown FROM max_balance ORDER BY ts",
            "refId": "A"
          }
        ]
      }
      // Additional panels would be defined here
    ],
    "refresh": "1m"
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Grafana installation and configuration
2. Test data source connections
3. Validate dashboard visualizations
4. Test alert functionality
5. Verify dashboard refresh works correctly
6. Test user authentication and access control
