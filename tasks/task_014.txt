# Test Strategy:
1. Run unit tests for all components
2. Execute integration tests for component interactions
3. Perform end-to-end tests for complete workflows
4. Conduct paper trading tests in live market conditions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Unit Test Implementation for Core Components [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop comprehensive unit tests for the core components of the trading system including strategy logic, risk management, and execution modules.
### Details:
Create isolated tests for each component with at least 90% code coverage. For strategy components, test entry/exit logic, indicator calculations, and signal generation. For risk management, test position sizing, stop-loss mechanisms, and exposure limits. For execution components, test order creation, validation, and handling of various order types. Use mock objects to simulate dependencies and verify expected behaviors under normal and edge cases.

## 2. Integration Tests for Component Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Implement integration tests to verify proper interactions between different components of the trading system.
### Details:
Focus on testing interfaces between strategy and risk management modules, risk management and execution modules, and data feed integration. Create test scenarios that validate data flow between components, proper event handling, and state management. Verify that component interactions maintain data integrity and follow expected workflows. Include tests for error handling and recovery mechanisms when one component fails or returns unexpected results.

## 3. End-to-End Tests for Complete Workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Description: Develop end-to-end tests that validate complete trading workflows from market data ingestion to order execution.
### Details:
Create test scenarios covering the entire trading process including data reception, strategy signal generation, risk assessment, order creation, and execution simulation. Test multiple market scenarios including trending, ranging, and volatile conditions. Implement validation checks for each stage of the workflow and verify final outcomes match expected results. Include regression tests for previously identified issues and critical paths. Document test coverage and maintain traceability to system requirements.

## 4. Paper Trading Test Setup in Live Market Conditions [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Configure and implement paper trading tests using real-time market data to validate system behavior in live conditions without risking capital.
### Details:
Set up a paper trading environment connected to live market data feeds. Implement logging and monitoring to track system decisions and performance metrics. Define success criteria including execution accuracy, latency measurements, and strategy performance metrics. Create comparison frameworks to evaluate paper trading results against backtested expectations. Test during different market sessions and volatility conditions to ensure consistent performance. Implement automated alerts for unexpected behaviors or performance deviations.

## 5. Walk-Forward Validation Test Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.3
### Description: Implement walk-forward validation testing to assess strategy robustness across different time periods and market conditions.
### Details:
Develop a walk-forward testing framework that divides historical data into multiple in-sample and out-of-sample periods. Implement optimization routines for the in-sample periods and validation on out-of-sample data. Create metrics to evaluate consistency of performance across different market regimes. Test parameter stability by analyzing sensitivity to small changes in inputs. Generate comprehensive reports showing performance metrics across all testing windows and identify potential overfitting issues.

## 6. Stress Testing for High-Frequency Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3, 14.4
### Description: Develop and execute stress tests to evaluate system performance under extreme market conditions and high-frequency trading scenarios.
### Details:
Create test scenarios simulating extreme market conditions including flash crashes, liquidity gaps, and high volatility events. Test system performance under increased message rates and order frequencies. Measure and validate system latency, throughput, and resource utilization under peak loads. Implement tests for failover mechanisms, error recovery, and circuit breakers. Verify risk management controls remain effective under stress conditions. Document performance bottlenecks and system limitations discovered during testing.
