# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Repository and Docker Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the repository structure, Dockerfile, and setup script for the NASOSv5_mod3 trading bot
# Details:
1. Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore
2. Create Dockerfile based on Python 3.11 with necessary dependencies (CCXT, aiohttp, etc.)
3. Create docker-compose.yml with services for all components (Freqtrade, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, Grafana, etc.)
4. Implement setup.sh script that:
   - Prompts for Binance API keys
   - Configures Docker environment
   - Sets up secure storage for API keys using Hashicorp Vault
   - Initializes database schemas
   - Provides colored CLI menu for initial configuration
5. Configure Docker Secrets for sensitive information
6. Implement Cloudflare Zero-Trust tunnel configuration for dashboard access

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Docker builds successfully
2. Test setup.sh script in clean environment
3. Validate that API keys are securely stored
4. Confirm all services start correctly via docker-compose up
5. Verify network connectivity between containers

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Git Repository with Project Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Git repository with the initial project structure, including directories for source code, configuration, documentation, and tests. Set up .gitignore and README.md with project overview.
### Details:
- Create repository on GitHub/GitLab
- Initialize local repository with git init
- Set up folder structure (src/, config/, docs/, tests/)
- Create comprehensive .gitignore for the project
- Write initial README.md with project description, setup instructions
- Add LICENSE file
- Make initial commit and push to remote

Acceptance Criteria:
- Repository is accessible with proper permissions
- Folder structure follows best practices
- README contains clear setup instructions
- .gitignore properly excludes sensitive files

Estimated Effort: 2-3 hours

## 2. Create Base Dockerfile for Application [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Develop a Dockerfile that defines the application environment, including all necessary dependencies, runtime configurations, and security hardening measures.
### Details:
- Select appropriate base image (Alpine/slim variants preferred)
- Install required dependencies and packages
- Configure application user with minimal permissions
- Set up application directory structure
- Implement multi-stage build to minimize image size
- Add health check configuration
- Document build arguments and environment variables

Acceptance Criteria:
- Dockerfile builds successfully without errors
- Container runs with non-root user
- Image size is optimized (<500MB if possible)
- All required dependencies are included
- Security best practices are implemented

Estimated Effort: 4-5 hours

## 3. Configure Docker Compose for Multi-Container Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create a docker-compose.yml file that defines all services, networks, and volumes required for the application, including development and production configurations.
### Details:
- Define all required services (app, database, cache, etc.)
- Configure service dependencies and startup order
- Set up named volumes for persistent data
- Create isolated networks for service communication
- Configure environment variables and secrets handling
- Add resource constraints for each service
- Create separate development and production configurations

Acceptance Criteria:
- All services start correctly with docker-compose up
- Services can communicate with each other
- Persistent data is properly stored in volumes
- Environment-specific configurations work as expected
- Resource limits are properly defined

Estimated Effort: 5-6 hours

## 4. Implement Setup Script for Environment Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Create an interactive setup script that guides users through the initial configuration process, including environment variables, secrets, and service configuration.
### Details:
- Write shell script for environment setup
- Implement interactive prompts for configuration options
- Add validation for user inputs
- Generate required configuration files
- Set up environment variables file (.env)
- Create backup and restore functionality
- Add documentation for script usage

Acceptance Criteria:
- Script runs without errors on target platforms
- All required configurations are properly set up
- User inputs are validated and sanitized
- Script provides clear feedback and instructions
- Configuration can be backed up and restored

Estimated Effort: 6-8 hours

## 5. Configure Security Services Integration [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Set up integration with Hashicorp Vault and Cloudflare for secrets management and secure communication, including authentication and authorization configurations.
### Details:
- Configure Hashicorp Vault container or external connection
- Set up Vault policies and access controls
- Implement secret rotation mechanism
- Configure Cloudflare SSL/TLS integration
- Set up secure API communication
- Document security architecture and procedures
- Create security testing scripts

Acceptance Criteria:
- Vault is properly configured and accessible
- Secrets are securely stored and retrieved
- SSL/TLS is properly configured for all services
- Security documentation is comprehensive
- Security tests pass successfully

Estimated Effort: 8-10 hours
